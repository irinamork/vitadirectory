She has been with her current partner for 10 years and they are raising 3 daughters together. The partnership itself is what prompted Stephanie to become interested in relationship coaching because she quickly realized that the very conscious and intentional nature of this partnership was something she did not experience in previous relationships and also not seeing amongst many other relationships.

She has found great meaning in being a witness and ally to those who also want to work their way through challenges, patterns, blocks and boredom.
